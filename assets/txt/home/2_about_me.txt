About Me

I am a 25 year old software engineer. I graduated from UVic in April of 2022 and have a year of work experience as a software developer.

I am an active person and enjoy going to the gym as well as playing rec league volleyball.
Some of my favorite pastimes include programming, micro-electronics, chess, and watching tv.
Recently, I started watching The Last Of Us on HBO and have really been enjoying it.
I also like both playing and watching StarCraft I and II.
