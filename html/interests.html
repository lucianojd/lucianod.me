                    Camping and Hiking

                    Camping and hiking are my favorite pastimes. I love being outdoors. Studying software engineering, I spend a lot of time inside and in front of a screen. 
                    I love what I am studying, but it would be unhealthy if I didn't take breaks.
                    My favorite hike so far has been the chief. The view is spectacular from the first peak. I'm planning on going back to hike the second and third peaks. 
                    The picture below is of my girlfriend and I at the lower falls in Golden Ears. 
                    We spent the weekend camping at Gold Creek.

                    Although I played volleyball at a post-secondary level. Basketball is by far my favorite sport to both watch and play. 
                    I didn't pursue basketball because I knew I had a far better chance of playing volleyball at a higher level. 
                    Despite how much I enjoy the game, I am not very good. 
                    I loved playing in high-school and now I occasionally get together with a couple friends and play. 
                    I don't watch much of the regular NBA season, but I love watching the playoffs

                    My high-school hosted a grade 9 trip to Europe. I got to tour through Belgium, France, Germany, Spain, and Italy. 
                    Italy was my favorite. While in Italy I got to take a gondola ride in Venice, walk inside the dome of the Duomo in Florence, and hike along the Cinqua Terre in Liguria. 
                    In France we got to go up the Eiffel Tower. My favorite part of the trip was the Sagrada Familia in Barcelona, Spain. 
                    I've also been to Edmonton and Calgary for various volleyball tournaments.

                <p>
                    I really enjoy reading. I've read: The Hunger Games series, The Hobbit, and The Shining alongside some other less known novels. 
                    My favorite author, hands down, is Stephen King. He does an incredible job of creating suspense.
                    My favorite story of his would have to be Rita Hayworth and The Shawshank Redemption. 
                    The movie The Shawshank Redemption is based on that story.
