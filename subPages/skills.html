	ECE 255 introduced me to the various components present in a computer. Memory, input and output devices, instruction cycles,
	assembly language, buses, and processors were covered in the course. I'm familiar with various memory types such as ROM, RAM
	,Hard Disk Drives, cache and processor registers. We covered the basics about memory structure and functionality. We covered
	interrupts and polling with input and output devices. The instruction cycle covered in the course was: fetch, decode, execute, store,
	and increment the program counter. I know how to build subroutines. We were introduced to the system bus; the system bus allows 
	communication between components. Register usage and the binary versions of instructions were covered. 
	Word length and the advantages and disadvantages of having longer words was taught as well.

	<p class="body">
	I've completed one 100 level course for linear algebra and two 100 level courses for calculus. I have completed a 200 level course for time signals and systems.
	Solving matrices, matrix arithmetic, eigenvalues and eigenvectors, transformation matrices, complex numbers, and working with spaces of 
	various dimension described by real or complex valued unit vectors are all concepts I've learned from linear algebra. Tools I've learned
	in calculus are derivation, integration and various techniques for performing the operations. In time signals and systems, I gained 
	the tools to convert a signal into a Fourier series and apply the Fourier transform and Laplace transform. The course introduced to the basics
	of sampling and interpolation, amplitude modulation, and modelling systems using differential equations.

	<p class="body">
	I am familiar with Java, C++, C, HTML, and CSS. I am also familiar with ARM Assembly
	language. Specifically, I've programmed the STM32 Cortexâ„¢-M0 processor in my Computer Architecture
	course: ECE 255. The languages I'm most familiar with are Java and C++; both languages were introduced
	to me in university. I've built multiple abstract data types using Java such as stacks, heaps, and binary search trees. I am confident I could build
	the same structures in C++. I've programmed a little in C, but I've never taken a class focused on the language.
	I learned both HTML and CSS in high-school. Aside from this website, I've never built any major projects
	using HTML and CSS.

	<p class="body">
	Communication is one of my best skills. Whether talking in person, through email or on the phone, I communicate effectively.
	I've completed multiple group projects while studying. I have worked in a group to design and present a solution to a problem
	on two occasions. The first occasion was at UFV. My group and I needed to design a device to collect algae; the algae was to
	be used as a food source in a remote village. We communicated regularly and delivered the presentation on time. The second group
	project I was a member of was at UVIC. My group and I needed to develop a method of reducing single occupancy vehicles in the
	CRD (Capital Region District) on Vancouver Island. We used slack to coordinate our group meetings. Often, I was the one initiating
	discussion about due dates and assignment criteria. The course instructor had his students complete smaller preliminary assignments 
	to ensure his students didn't fall behind. My group and I never missed a due date while building our solution.

	I'm a confident speaker. I've given multiple presentations throughout university. Being a part of
	the volleyball team also helped me become a better speaker. Volleyball gave me plenty of practice being in front of large crowds.
	I have given a total of three oral presentations in my engineering courses. My English courses required me to give one group presentation;
	two speeches presented by myself were also required.

			Teamwork
		</h2>
	</a>
	<p class="body">
	I owe my teamwork abilities to the numerous sports teams I've been a part of.  I played, throughout high-school, both volleyball and basketball.
	Most recently, I played on The University of The Fraser Valley men's volleyball team. Emotions can run rampant during a match or even practice;
	conflict between teammates in stressful situations is extremely common. However, experiencing tense situations between teammates has allowed me to build
	excellent teamwork skills. I am able to compromise, maintain constructive discussions, and act professionally. My teamwork skills have earned me
	multiple jobs. I have worked at Costco Wholesale Langley and the City of Surrey South Operations Yard. Both jobs require you to work effectively
	with your co-workers in order to complete tasks.
