	<h2>
		University of Victoria
	</h2>
		<p>
		I transferred to UVIC to complete a Bachelor's degree in Software Engineering. My estimated graduation year is 2021.
		</p>
	<h2>
		The University of The Fraser Valley (UFV)
	</h2>
		<p>
		I completed the University of The Fraser Valley's Engineering Transfer program over two years. Alongside my schoolwork,
		I played on the men's volleyball team. We practised for two hours four days of the week. Our games took place on Friday 
		and Saturday evenings. UFV is where I determined which engineering practice I wanted to study. I spent one summer working
		at Costco Wholesale in Langley. The second summer I worked with The City of Surrey temporary summer labourers.
		</p>
	<h2>
		High School
	</h2>
		<p>
		I attended Langley Fundamental Middle Secondary School. While in high school I played both volleyball and basketball.
		I played club volleyball in the summer. I worked part time at my uncle's business Stuffer's Supply Co.
